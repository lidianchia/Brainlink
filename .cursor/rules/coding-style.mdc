# Coding Style

- Follow repository ESLint rules: [`eslint.config.mjs`](mdc:eslint.config.mjs) and formatting via [`prettier.config.mjs`](mdc:prettier.config.mjs).
- Prefer meaningful, descriptive names; avoid cryptic abbreviations.
- Keep components presentational and focused; extract reusable UI into `src/components/ui/`.
- For data loading of large JSON, prefer lazy loading and client-side splitting when possible.
- Keep comments concise and explain "why" rather than "how" for non-trivial logic.
