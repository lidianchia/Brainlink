# MDX Usage

- Author content pages as `.mdx` under [`src/pages/posts/`](mdc:src/pages/posts/).
- Component mappings for MDX are in [`src/mdx-components.js`](mdc:src/mdx-components.js). Extend this when introducing new MDX components.
- Keep presentational components in `src/components/` and re-use them via MDX mapping.
- For images/assets referenced in MDX, place them in `public/` and reference via absolute paths.
